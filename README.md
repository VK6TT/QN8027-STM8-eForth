# QN8027-STM8eForth
Interface QN8027 FM stereo broadcasting chip to the STM8 micro.

  The QN8027 is a high performance, low power, full-
  featured single-chip stereo FM transmitter designed for
  portable audio/video players, automotive accessories, cell
  phones, and GPS personal navigation devices. The
  QN8027 covers frequencies from 76 MHz to 108 MHz in
  50/100/200 kHz step sizes for worldwide FM band support.
  The QN8027 also supports RDS/RBDS data transmit.

Sounds terrific and availalbe from eBay and AliExpress for very little.
However, there is very scant information on how to use the chip and the datasheet is vague at times.

Hopefully this code will allow you to get started. My initial impression of the QN8027 device is very favouirable.

I will also upload soon some code I used to debug how the device worked. 
Forth programmers already know how useful Forth is when dealing with strange hardware. I totally recommend Thomas's STM8eForth implemention to you.
